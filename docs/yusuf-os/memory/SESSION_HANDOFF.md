# Session Handoff (rolling log — trim superseded entries, don't let this become a transcript dump)

## 2026-08-17 — Onboarding pass (Claude Code, Sonnet 5)

**Branch/HEAD at session start:** `feature/yusuf-os-core` @ `3aec848f2885144aa8f1e53b9731a04310d5d558`.
Working tree had the Gate C changes present but uncommitted (unstaged modifications +
untracked new files) — unchanged by this session.

**What was done:** Full onboarding/verification pass per Yusuf's handoff prompt. No production
code was written or modified. Specifically:
- Verified git topology (origin = Yusuf fork, upstream push disabled, on `feature/yusuf-os-core`).
- Read Gate B README + verdict (`docs/yusuf-os/gate-b/`) and the Gate C engineering-intelligence
  record (`.engineering-intelligence/gate-c.md`).
- Independently read the actual Gate C source (not just docs): capability registry, PolicyEngine,
  YusufActionBoundary, ApprovalService, ExecutionCoordinator, AuditService, IntentCanonicalizer/
  IntentService, controlPlaneGuard, SecuritySettings, redaction, principals, constants, the
  `/api/yusuf-os` endpoint file, and the full diff of every modified upstream file (aibitat,
  defaults, ephemeral, imported, MCP, agentFlows, scheduled-job runner/model/endpoint, index.js).
- Read `runtimeBoundary.test.js` and `securityCore.test.js` in full to confirm the claimed
  adversarial coverage is real, not just described.
- Re-ran the test suites live (from repo root, with test-only `YUSUF_OS_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` /
  `YUSUF_OS_CONTROL_TOKEN` env vars): 13/13 Yusuf-OS-plus-affected-upstream suites (100/100
  tests), then 42/42 full server suites (392/392 tests) — both matched the recorded baseline
  exactly. Also ran `eslint .` (clean) and `git diff --check` (clean).
- Answered all of Gate C's mandatory verification questions from actual code, not from the
  record — no gaps found. See `GATE_HISTORY.md`.
- Created root `CLAUDE.md` (did not exist before) and the full `docs/yusuf-os/memory/` directory
  (did not exist before) — this file and its 13 siblings.

**Tests:** see `TEST_BASELINE.md` — all green, live-verified.

**Security review outcome:** No P0 or P1 findings. Gate C's own claimed verdict
(PASS, P0=0, P1=0) is corroborated by independent re-verification this session.

**What remains:** Nothing for Gate C. Gate D (governed LocalGit vertical slice) is the next
planned work — see `CURRENT_GATE.md` — but was explicitly **not started** this session per the
handoff prompt's instruction to stop after onboarding.

**Current blocker:** None technical. Waiting on Yusuf's explicit "START GATE D" instruction
before any Gate D implementation begins.

**Exact next action for the next session:** If Yusuf says to start Gate D, first re-read
`docs/yusuf-os/gate-b/adapter-governance.md` §3 (LocalGit contract) and
`docs/yusuf-os/gate-b/implementation-plan.md` §§5-8 in full (they were not re-read line-by-line
this session — only referenced), then design the disposable local-repo + bare-remote test fixture
before writing any adapter code. If Yusuf asks for something else instead, this memory set gives
enough context to skip re-deriving Gate B/C from scratch.

**Do not repeat:** the full Gate B/Gate C re-verification above — it's captured in
`GATE_HISTORY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_INVARIANTS.md`, and `TEST_BASELINE.md`. A future session should
only re-verify from scratch if something looks like it changed, not by default.
